# automatic-happiness
Hi there! Welcome to my professional GitHub, where I will include a heterogenous mixture of my Data Science for Biologists classwork and real-world data analysis projects from RStudio. I have greatly enjoyed my (ongoing) experiences learning R, and the projects within this repository bring me ***automatic-happiness***.
